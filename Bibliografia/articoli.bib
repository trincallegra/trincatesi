	abstract = {Objective and design We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of adverse events in the emergency department (ED) during procedural sedation in the paediatric population. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies from the past 10 years were included. We adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Setting ED.Participants Children.Interventions Procedural sedation.Outcomes Adverse events like vomiting, agitation, hypoxia and apnoea. Meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported as incidence rates with 95\% CIs.Results A total of 1177 studies were retrieved for screening and 258 were selected for full-text review. 41 studies reporting on 13 883 procedural sedations in 13 876 children (<=18 years) were included. The most common adverse events (all reported per 1000 sedations) were: vomiting 55.5 (CI 45.2 to 65.8), agitation 17.9 (CI 12.2 to 23.7), hypoxia 14.8 (CI 10.2 to 19.3) and apnoea 7.1 (CI 3.2 to 11.0). The need to intervene with either bag valve mask, oral airway or positive pressure ventilation occurred in 5.0 per 1000 sedations (CI 2.3 to 7.6). The incidences of severe respiratory events were: 34 cases of laryngospasm among 8687 sedations (2.9 per 1000 sedations, CI 1.1 to 4.7; absolute rate 3.9 per 1000 sedations), 4 intubations among 9136 sedations and 0 cases of aspiration among 3326 sedations. 33 of the 34 cases of laryngospasm occurred in patients who received ketamine.Conclusions Serious adverse respiratory events are very rare in paediatric procedural sedation in the ED. Emesis and agitation are the most frequent adverse events. Hypoxia, a late indicator of respiratory depression, occurs in 1.5\% of sedations. Laryngospasm, though rare, happens most frequently with ketamine. The results of this study provide quantitative risk estimates to facilitate shared decision-making, risk communication, informed consent and resource allocation in children undergoing procedural sedation in the ED.},

abstract={Pediatric pain is common, and memory for it may be distressing and have long-lasting effects. Children who develop more negatively biased memories for pain (ie, recalled pain is higher than initial pain report) are at risk of worse future pain outcomes. In adolescent samples, higher child and parent catastrophic thinking about pain was associated with negatively biased memories for postsurgical pain. This study examined the influence of child and parent anxiety on the development of younger children's postsurgical pain memories. Seventy-eight children undergoing a tonsillectomy and one of their parents participated. Parents reported on their anxiety (state and trait) before surgery, and trained researchers observationally coded children's anxiety at anaesthesia induction. Children reported on their postsurgical pain intensity and pain-related fear for 3 days after discharge. One month after surgery, children recalled their pain intensity and pain-related fear using the same scales previously administered. Results revealed that higher levels of postsurgical pain and higher parent trait anxiety predicted more negatively biased memories for pain-related fear. Parent state anxiety and child preoperative anxiety were not associated with children's recall. Children who developed negatively biased pain memories had worse postsurgical pain several days after surgery. These findings underscore the importance of reducing parental anxiety and effective postsurgical pain management to potentially buffer against the development of negatively biased pain memories in young children.},

Although there is a rich body of research on the development of children's memory for the details of personally experienced events, relatively little is known about age-related changes in the ability to remember pain. This gap in the literature is surprising, given that studies of children's memory for painful experiences are relevant to our basic understanding of cognitive development, pain perception, and{\^a}{\texteuro}''in some situations{\^a}{\texteuro}''patient management. This article examines what is known about children's memory for pain, given its inherent importance, working from the vantage point of the literature on the development of autobiographical memory. In doing so, the authors make use of an informal information-processing framework to organize their thoughts about the acquisition, retention, and distortion of information about painful experiences. Nonetheless, the authors recognize that this framework will no doubt need to be modified to take into account the complex memory representations{\^a}{\texteuro}''containing somatosensory, affective, and contextual information{\^a}{\texteuro}''that are established after exposure to painful stimulation. After the treatment of the literature, the authors discuss its implications for the clinical management of pain in pediatric settings.Address for reprints: Peter A.

abstract={Propofol is an intravenous agent used commonly for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia, procedural, and critical care sedation in children. The mechanisms of action on the central nervous system involve interactions at various neurotransmitter receptors, especially the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor. Approved for use in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration in 1989, its use for induction of anesthesia in children less than 3{\^A} years of age still remains off-label. Despite its wide use in pediatric anesthesia, there is conflicting literature about its safety and serious adverse effects in particular subsets of children. Particularly as children are not {\^a}{\texteuro}{\oe}little adults{\^a}{\texteuro}, in this review, we emphasizethe maturational aspects of propofol pharmacokinetics. Despite the myriad of propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies and the ability to use allometrical scaling to smooth out differences due to size and age, there is no optimal model that can be used in target controlled infusion pumps for providing closed loop total intravenous anesthesia in children. As the commercial formulation of propofol is a nutrient-rich emulsion, the risk for bacterial contamination exists despite the Food and Drug Administration mandating addition of antimicrobial preservative, calling for manufacturers{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} directions to discard open vials after 6{\^A} h. While propofol has advantages over inhalation anesthesia such as less postoperative nausea and emergence delirium in children, pain on injection remains a problem even with newer formulations. Propofol is known to depress mitochondrial function by its action as an uncoupling agent in oxidative phosphorylation. This has implications for children with mitochondrial diseases and the occurrence of propofol-related infusion syndrome, a rare but seriously life-threatening complication of propofol. At the time of this review, there is no direct evidence in humans for propofol-induced neurotoxicity to the infant brain; however, current concerns of neuroapoptosis in developing brains induced by propofol persist and continue to be a focus of research.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of propofol for paediatric procedural sedation (PPS) is increasing because of its favourable pharmacodynamic profile. Its paediatric use has been limited in some ED (emergency departments) because of the perceived high rate of serious adverse events in comparison with other sedation agents. A systematic literature review of propofol use for PPS outside the operating theatre environment from 1966 to 2008 was carried out to profile the adverse event rate in comparison with other procedural sedation agents. Sixty studies with a total of 17 066 paediatric propofol sedations in a variety of hospital settings were identified. The incidence of complications were: desaturation 9.3\%, apnoea 1.9\%, assisted ventilation 1.4\%, hypotension 15.4\%, unplanned intubation 0.02\%, emesis post procedure 0.14\%, laryngospasm 0.1\% and bradycardia 0.1\%. There were no reported incidents of aspiration or emesis during sedation and there were no deaths associated with procedural propofol sedation. The use of propofol for PPS is associated with a low rate of minor adverse events that are all reversible with minimal intervention and do not produce long-term sequelae and occur at similar rates to minor adverse events experienced with other sedation agents. Major adverse events with propofol sedation are extremely rare and appropriate patient and procedure selection would decrease these risks further. The increasing use of propofol for ED PPS is supported by the current evidence because of its comparable adverse event rate to other agents.},

abstract = {Ketamine's clinical use began in the 1970s. Physicians benefited from its safety and ability to induce short-term anesthesia and analgesia. The psychodysleptic effects caused by the drug called its further clinical use into question. Despite these unpleasant effects, ketamine is still applied in veterinary medicine, field medicine, and specialist anesthesia. Recent intensive research brought into light new possible applications of this drug. It began to be used in acute, chronic and cancer pain management. Most interesting reports come from research on the antidepressive and antisuicidal properties of ketamine giving hope for the creation of an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Other reports highlight the possible use of ketamine in treating addiction, asthma and preventing cancer growth. Besides clinical use, the drug is also applied to in animal model of schizophrenia. It seems that nowadays, with numerous possible applications, the use of ketamine has returned; to its former glory. Nevertheless, the drug must be used with caution because still the mechanisms by which it executes its functions and long-term effects of its use are not fully known. This review aims to discuss the well-known and new promising applications of ketamine.}

abstract={As pediatric imaging capabilities have increased in scope, so have the complexities of providing procedural sedation in this environment. While efforts by many organizations have dramatically increased the safety of pediatric procedural sedation in general, radiology sedation creates several special challenges for the sedation provider. These challenges require implementation of additional safeguards to promote safety during sedation while maintaining effective and efficient care. Multiple agent options are available, and decisions regarding which agent(s) to use should be determined by both patient needs (i.e., developmental capacities, underlying health status, and previous experiences) and procedural needs (i.e., duration, need for immobility, and invasiveness). Increasingly, combinations of agents to either achieve the conditions required or mitigate/counterbalance adverse effects of single agents are being utilized with success. To continue to provide effective imaging sedation, it is incumbent on sedation providers to maintain familiarity with continuing evolutions within radiology environments, as well as comfort and competence with multiple sedation agents/regimens. This review discusses the challenges associated with radiology sedation and outlines various available agent options and combinations, with the intent of facilitating appropriate matching of agent(s) with patient and procedural needs.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the most widely used options for minimal/moderate sedation in pediatric patients is oral midazolam, as it presents an alternative to less well-accepted routes of administration (eg, intravenous or intranasal) of this well-known efficacious and well-tolerated short-acting benzodiazepine. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral midazolam for sedation in pediatric patients in the context of premedication before anesthesia or during diagnostic/treatment procedures. The percentage of responders (response rate) after single administration of oral midazolam was evaluated and compared versus placebo in a subset of placebo-controlled studies. The range of oral midazolam doses providing effective sedation in the different pediatric age subsets was analyzed in order to assess optimum dosing strategies. A total of 25 pediatric clinical studies, utilizing a variety of measures of sedation effectiveness, were selected. These studies included a total of 1472 patients (aged 4 months-18 years) treated with midazolam (0.25-1.5 mg/kg) and 138 patients treated with placebo. The response rates [95\% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranged from 36.7\% [21.6\%, 54.9\%] to 97.8\% [86.1\%, 99.7\%], while with placebo response rates ranged from 4.0\% [0.6\%, 23.5\%] to 41.0\% [29.4\%, 53.6\%]. When considering the 4 placebo-controlled studies, the odds ratios [95\% confidence interval] for the comparison of midazolam vs. placebo ranged from 13.4 [5.0, 36.0] to 25.9 [6.7, 100.6]. The analysis of subgroups by context of sedation showed response rates [95\% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranging from 36.7\% [21.6\%, 54.9\%] to 97.0\% [94.8\%, 98.3\%] for anesthetic premedication and from 56.1\% [43.1\%, 68.4] to 97.8\% [86.1\%, 99.7\%] for medical procedures. The efficacy of midazolam for pediatric minimal/moderate sedation from a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and above was demonstrated. The probability of occurrence of adverse events and over-sedation increases with increasing doses.},

abstract="The actions of benzodiazepines are due to the potentiation of the neural inhibition that is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABAA receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABAA receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines are sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation and anti-convulsant activity. In addition to their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and they also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as a result of a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepines, widely used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam and the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is important in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in the biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but they slow down the elimination of the other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based on clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam has the shortest recovery profile followed by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by CYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many clinically significant interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokinetic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam are widely used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose.",
