	abstract = {Objective and design We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the incidence of adverse events in the emergency department (ED) during procedural sedation in the paediatric population. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies from the past 10 years were included. We adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Setting ED.Participants Children.Interventions Procedural sedation.Outcomes Adverse events like vomiting, agitation, hypoxia and apnoea. Meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported as incidence rates with 95\% CIs.Results A total of 1177 studies were retrieved for screening and 258 were selected for full-text review. 41 studies reporting on 13 883 procedural sedations in 13 876 children (<=18 years) were included. The most common adverse events (all reported per 1000 sedations) were: vomiting 55.5 (CI 45.2 to 65.8), agitation 17.9 (CI 12.2 to 23.7), hypoxia 14.8 (CI 10.2 to 19.3) and apnoea 7.1 (CI 3.2 to 11.0). The need to intervene with either bag valve mask, oral airway or positive pressure ventilation occurred in 5.0 per 1000 sedations (CI 2.3 to 7.6). The incidences of severe respiratory events were: 34 cases of laryngospasm among 8687 sedations (2.9 per 1000 sedations, CI 1.1 to 4.7; absolute rate 3.9 per 1000 sedations), 4 intubations among 9136 sedations and 0 cases of aspiration among 3326 sedations. 33 of the 34 cases of laryngospasm occurred in patients who received ketamine.Conclusions Serious adverse respiratory events are very rare in paediatric procedural sedation in the ED. Emesis and agitation are the most frequent adverse events. Hypoxia, a late indicator of respiratory depression, occurs in 1.5\% of sedations. Laryngospasm, though rare, happens most frequently with ketamine. The results of this study provide quantitative risk estimates to facilitate shared decision-making, risk communication, informed consent and resource allocation in children undergoing procedural sedation in the ED.},

abstract={Pediatric pain is common, and memory for it may be distressing and have long-lasting effects. Children who develop more negatively biased memories for pain (ie, recalled pain is higher than initial pain report) are at risk of worse future pain outcomes. In adolescent samples, higher child and parent catastrophic thinking about pain was associated with negatively biased memories for postsurgical pain. This study examined the influence of child and parent anxiety on the development of younger children's postsurgical pain memories. Seventy-eight children undergoing a tonsillectomy and one of their parents participated. Parents reported on their anxiety (state and trait) before surgery, and trained researchers observationally coded children's anxiety at anaesthesia induction. Children reported on their postsurgical pain intensity and pain-related fear for 3 days after discharge. One month after surgery, children recalled their pain intensity and pain-related fear using the same scales previously administered. Results revealed that higher levels of postsurgical pain and higher parent trait anxiety predicted more negatively biased memories for pain-related fear. Parent state anxiety and child preoperative anxiety were not associated with children's recall. Children who developed negatively biased pain memories had worse postsurgical pain several days after surgery. These findings underscore the importance of reducing parental anxiety and effective postsurgical pain management to potentially buffer against the development of negatively biased pain memories in young children.},

abstract={ABSTRACT. Although there is a rich body of research on the development of children's memory for the details of personally experienced events, relatively little is known about age-related changes in the ability to remember pain. This gap in the literature is surprising, given that studies of children's memory for painful experiences are relevant to our basic understanding of cognitive development, pain perception, and{\^a}{\texteuro}''in some situations{\^a}{\texteuro}''patient management. This article examines what is known about children's memory for pain, given its inherent importance, working from the vantage point of the literature on the development of autobiographical memory. In doing so, the authors make use of an informal information-processing framework to organize their thoughts about the acquisition, retention, and distortion of information about painful experiences. Nonetheless, the authors recognize that this framework will no doubt need to be modified to take into account the complex memory representations{\^a}{\texteuro}''containing somatosensory, affective, and contextual information{\^a}{\texteuro}''that are established after exposure to painful stimulation. After the treatment of the literature, the authors discuss its implications for the clinical management of pain in pediatric settings.Address for reprints: Peter A.

abstract={Propofol is an intravenous agent used commonly for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia, procedural, and critical care sedation in children. The mechanisms of action on the central nervous system involve interactions at various neurotransmitter receptors, especially the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor. Approved for use in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration in 1989, its use for induction of anesthesia in children less than 3{\^A} years of age still remains off-label. Despite its wide use in pediatric anesthesia, there is conflicting literature about its safety and serious adverse effects in particular subsets of children. Particularly as children are not {\^a}{\texteuro}{\oe}little adults{\^a}{\texteuro}, in this review, we emphasizethe maturational aspects of propofol pharmacokinetics. Despite the myriad of propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies and the ability to use allometrical scaling to smooth out differences due to size and age, there is no optimal model that can be used in target controlled infusion pumps for providing closed loop total intravenous anesthesia in children. As the commercial formulation of propofol is a nutrient-rich emulsion, the risk for bacterial contamination exists despite the Food and Drug Administration mandating addition of antimicrobial preservative, calling for manufacturers{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} directions to discard open vials after 6{\^A} h. While propofol has advantages over inhalation anesthesia such as less postoperative nausea and emergence delirium in children, pain on injection remains a problem even with newer formulations. Propofol is known to depress mitochondrial function by its action as an uncoupling agent in oxidative phosphorylation. This has implications for children with mitochondrial diseases and the occurrence of propofol-related infusion syndrome, a rare but seriously life-threatening complication of propofol. At the time of this review, there is no direct evidence in humans for propofol-induced neurotoxicity to the infant brain; however, current concerns of neuroapoptosis in developing brains induced by propofol persist and continue to be a focus of research.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of propofol for paediatric procedural sedation (PPS) is increasing because of its favourable pharmacodynamic profile. Its paediatric use has been limited in some ED (emergency departments) because of the perceived high rate of serious adverse events in comparison with other sedation agents. A systematic literature review of propofol use for PPS outside the operating theatre environment from 1966 to 2008 was carried out to profile the adverse event rate in comparison with other procedural sedation agents. Sixty studies with a total of 17 066 paediatric propofol sedations in a variety of hospital settings were identified. The incidence of complications were: desaturation 9.3\%, apnoea 1.9\%, assisted ventilation 1.4\%, hypotension 15.4\%, unplanned intubation 0.02\%, emesis post procedure 0.14\%, laryngospasm 0.1\% and bradycardia 0.1\%. There were no reported incidents of aspiration or emesis during sedation and there were no deaths associated with procedural propofol sedation. The use of propofol for PPS is associated with a low rate of minor adverse events that are all reversible with minimal intervention and do not produce long-term sequelae and occur at similar rates to minor adverse events experienced with other sedation agents. Major adverse events with propofol sedation are extremely rare and appropriate patient and procedure selection would decrease these risks further. The increasing use of propofol for ED PPS is supported by the current evidence because of its comparable adverse event rate to other agents.},

abstract = {Ketamine's clinical use began in the 1970s. Physicians benefited from its safety and ability to induce short-term anesthesia and analgesia. The psychodysleptic effects caused by the drug called its further clinical use into question. Despite these unpleasant effects, ketamine is still applied in veterinary medicine, field medicine, and specialist anesthesia. Recent intensive research brought into light new possible applications of this drug. It began to be used in acute, chronic and cancer pain management. Most interesting reports come from research on the antidepressive and antisuicidal properties of ketamine giving hope for the creation of an effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Other reports highlight the possible use of ketamine in treating addiction, asthma and preventing cancer growth. Besides clinical use, the drug is also applied to in animal model of schizophrenia. It seems that nowadays, with numerous possible applications, the use of ketamine has returned; to its former glory. Nevertheless, the drug must be used with caution because still the mechanisms by which it executes its functions and long-term effects of its use are not fully known. This review aims to discuss the well-known and new promising applications of ketamine.}

abstract={As pediatric imaging capabilities have increased in scope, so have the complexities of providing procedural sedation in this environment. While efforts by many organizations have dramatically increased the safety of pediatric procedural sedation in general, radiology sedation creates several special challenges for the sedation provider. These challenges require implementation of additional safeguards to promote safety during sedation while maintaining effective and efficient care. Multiple agent options are available, and decisions regarding which agent(s) to use should be determined by both patient needs (i.e., developmental capacities, underlying health status, and previous experiences) and procedural needs (i.e., duration, need for immobility, and invasiveness). Increasingly, combinations of agents to either achieve the conditions required or mitigate/counterbalance adverse effects of single agents are being utilized with success. To continue to provide effective imaging sedation, it is incumbent on sedation providers to maintain familiarity with continuing evolutions within radiology environments, as well as comfort and competence with multiple sedation agents/regimens. This review discusses the challenges associated with radiology sedation and outlines various available agent options and combinations, with the intent of facilitating appropriate matching of agent(s) with patient and procedural needs.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the most widely used options for minimal/moderate sedation in pediatric patients is oral midazolam, as it presents an alternative to less well-accepted routes of administration (eg, intravenous or intranasal) of this well-known efficacious and well-tolerated short-acting benzodiazepine. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral midazolam for sedation in pediatric patients in the context of premedication before anesthesia or during diagnostic/treatment procedures. The percentage of responders (response rate) after single administration of oral midazolam was evaluated and compared versus placebo in a subset of placebo-controlled studies. The range of oral midazolam doses providing effective sedation in the different pediatric age subsets was analyzed in order to assess optimum dosing strategies. A total of 25 pediatric clinical studies, utilizing a variety of measures of sedation effectiveness, were selected. These studies included a total of 1472 patients (aged 4 months-18 years) treated with midazolam (0.25-1.5 mg/kg) and 138 patients treated with placebo. The response rates [95\% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranged from 36.7\% [21.6\%, 54.9\%] to 97.8\% [86.1\%, 99.7\%], while with placebo response rates ranged from 4.0\% [0.6\%, 23.5\%] to 41.0\% [29.4\%, 53.6\%]. When considering the 4 placebo-controlled studies, the odds ratios [95\% confidence interval] for the comparison of midazolam vs. placebo ranged from 13.4 [5.0, 36.0] to 25.9 [6.7, 100.6]. The analysis of subgroups by context of sedation showed response rates [95\% confidence interval] with oral midazolam ranging from 36.7\% [21.6\%, 54.9\%] to 97.0\% [94.8\%, 98.3\%] for anesthetic premedication and from 56.1\% [43.1\%, 68.4] to 97.8\% [86.1\%, 99.7\%] for medical procedures. The efficacy of midazolam for pediatric minimal/moderate sedation from a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and above was demonstrated. The probability of occurrence of adverse events and over-sedation increases with increasing doses.},

abstract="The actions of benzodiazepines are due to the potentiation of the neural inhibition that is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABAA receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABAA receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines are sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation and anti-convulsant activity. In addition to their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and they also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as a result of a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepines, widely used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam and the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is important in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in the biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but they slow down the elimination of the other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based on clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam has the shortest recovery profile followed by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by CYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many clinically significant interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokinetic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam are widely used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose.",

abstract={Dexmedetomidine (Dexdor{\^A}®) is a highly selective {\^I}{\textpm}2-adrenoceptor agonist. It has sedative, analgesic and opioid-sparing effects and is suitable for short- and longer-term sedation in an intensive care setting. In the randomized, double-blind, multicentre MIDEX and PRODEX trials, longer-term sedation with dexmedetomidine was noninferior to midazolam and propofol in terms of time spent at the target sedation range, as well as being associated with a shorter time to extubation than midazolam or propofol, and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation than midazolam. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine were also easier to rouse, more co-operative and better able to communicate than patients receiving midazolam or propofol. Dexmedetomidine had beneficial effects on delirium in some randomized, controlled trials (e.g. patients receiving dexmedetomidine were less likely to experience delirium than patients receiving midazolam, propofol or remifentanil and had more delirium- and coma-free days than patients receiving lorazepam). Intravenous dexmedetomidine had an acceptable tolerability profile; hypotension, hypertension and bradycardia were the most commonly reported adverse reactions. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine is an important option for sedation in the intensive care setting.},

abstract={Dexmedetomidine is an {\^I}{\textpm}2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, anxiolytic, sympatholytic, and analgesic-sparing effects, and minimal depression of respiratory function. It is potent and highly selective for {\^I}{\textpm}2-receptors with an {\^I}{\textpm}2:{\^I}{\textpm}1 ratio of 1620:1. Hemodynamic effects, which include transient hypertension, bradycardia, and hypotension, result from the drug{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s peripheral vasoconstrictive and sympatholytic properties. Dexmedetomidine exerts its hypnotic action through activation of central pre- and postsynaptic {\^I}{\textpm}2-receptors in the locus coeruleus, thereby inducting a state of unconsciousness similar to natural sleep, with the unique aspect that patients remain easily rousable and cooperative. Dexmedetomidine is rapidly distributed and is mainly hepatically metabolized into inactive metabolites by glucuronidation and hydroxylation. A high inter-individual variability in dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics has been described, especially in the intensive care unit population. In recent years, multiple pharmacokinetic non-compartmental analyses as well as population pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. Body size, hepatic impairment, and presumably plasma albumin and cardiac output have a significant impact on dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics. Results regarding other covariates remain inconclusive and warrant further research. Although initially approved for intravenous use for up to 24{\^A} h in the adult intensive care unit population only, applications of dexmedetomidine in clinical practice have been widened over the past few years. Procedural sedation with dexmedetomidine was additionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and dexmedetomidine has appeared useful in multiple off-label applications such as pediatric sedation, intranasal or buccal administration, and use as an adjuvant to local analgesia techniques.},

abstract={Since the first report of clonidine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, the indications for this class of drugs have continued to expand. In December 1999, dexmedetomidine was approved as the most recent agent in this group and was introduced into clinical practice as a short-term sedative (<24 hours). Alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists have several beneficial actions during the perioperative period. They decrease sympathetic tone, with attenuation of the neuroendocrine and hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery; reduce anesthetic and opioid requirements; and cause sedation and analgesia. They allow psychomotoric function to be preserved while letting the patient rest comfortably. With this combination of effects, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists may offer benefits in the prophylaxis and adjuvant treatment of perioperative myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, their role in pain management and regional anesthesia is expanding. Side effects consist of mild to moderate cardiovascular depression, with slight decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. The development of new, more selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists with improved side effect profiles may provide a new concept for the administration of perioperative anesthesia and analgesia. This review aims to give background information to improve understanding of the properties and applications of the novel alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine.},

Materials and Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE for clinical trials comparing dexmedetomidine and midazolam for procedural sedation up to June 20, 2016. Inclusion criteria: clinical trial, human subjects, adult subjects (≥18 years), article written in English, German, French or Dutch, use of study medication for conscious sedation and at least one group receiving dexmedetomidine and one group receiving midazolam. Exclusion criteria: patients in intensive care, pediatric subjects and per protocol use of additional sedative medication other than rescue medication. Outcome measures for efficacy comparison were patient and clinician satisfaction scores and pain scores; outcome measures for safety comparison were hypotension, hypoxia, and circulatory and respiratory complications.   Results We identified 89 papers, of which 12 satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 883 patients were included in these studies. Dexmedetomidine was associated with higher patient and operator satisfaction than midazolam. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine experienced less pain and had lower analgesic requirements. Respiratory and hemodynamic safety were similar.   Conclusions Dexmedetomidine is a promising alternative to midazolam for use in procedural sedation. Dexmedetomidine provides more comfort during the procedure for the patient and clinician. If carefully titrated, the safety profiles are similar.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Sedation is increasingly used to facilitate procedures on children in emergency departments (EDs). This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) examines the safety and efficacy of sedative agents commonly used for procedural sedation in children in the ED or similar settings. Methods We followed standard SR methods: comprehensive search; dual study selection, quality assessment, data extraction. We included SRs of children (1 month to 18 years) where the indication for sedation was procedure-related and performed in the ED. Results Fourteen SRs were included (210 primary studies). The most data were available for propofol (six reviews/50,472 sedations) followed by ketamine (7/8,238), nitrous oxide (5/8,220), and midazolam (4/4,978). Inconsistent conclusions for propofol were reported across six reviews. Half concluded that propofol was sufficiently safe; three reviews noted a higher occurrence of adverse events, particularly respiratory depression (upper estimate 1.1\%; 5.4\% for hypotension requiring intervention). Efficacy of propofol was considered in four reviews and found adequate in three. Five reviews found ketamine to be efficacious and seven reviews showed it to be safe. All five reviews of nitrous oxide concluded it is safe (0.1\% incidence of respiratory events); most found it effective in cooperative children. Four reviews of midazolam made varying recommendations. To be effective, midazolam should be combined with another agent that increases the risk of adverse events (upper estimate 9.1\% for desaturation, 0.1\% for hypotension requiring intervention). Conclusions This comprehensive examination of an extensive body of literature shows consistent safety and efficacy for nitrous oxide and ketamine, with very rare significant adverse events for propofol. There was considerable heterogeneity in outcomes and reporting across studies and previous reviews. Standardized outcome sets and reporting should be encouraged to facilitate evidence-based recommendations for care.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Despite being a standard of care for children undergoing stressful procedures, little data exist on parental perception of pediatric sedation. Aims This study aimed to investigate recovery characteristics and parental satisfaction for pediatric sedations performed with four widely used sedative regimens. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health of Trieste, Italy, enrolling children undergoing procedural sedation with one of the following pharmacological regimens: propofol, propofol + midazolam, ketamine + propofol, and dexmedetomidine + midazolam. A questionnaire was used to assess the occurrence of symptoms upon recovery from sedation and the following day, and the caregivers' satisfaction for both the recovery pattern and the overall sedation experience, according to a numerical rating scale (0–10). Answers were collected through a telephone survey. The primary outcome was the difference in the quality of the recovery as perceived by caregivers; the secondary and tertiary outcomes were the perceived quality of the overall sedation experience and the frequency of sedation-related adverse events, respectively. Results Data from 655 patients, 149 receiving propofol, 245 propofol + midazolam, 134 ketamine + propofol, and 127 dexmedetomidine + midazolam, were analyzed. The level of parents' satisfaction for both the recovery and the sedation experience was overall high and increased with the patients' age in all the pharmacological groups (Spearman's rank correlation, ρ .083, p = .033, and ρ .087, p = .026, respectively), with no statistically significant differences between groups when adjusting for age. The occurrence of irritability, prolonged sleepiness, hyperactivity, unsteadiness, hallucinations, emesis, and respiratory distress at any moment negatively affected parental satisfaction. Conclusions In this study, caregivers' satisfaction with pediatric sedation was high, regardless of the regimen used. Lower parental satisfaction was associated with younger age, irritability after sedation, prolonged sleepiness, hyperactivity, unsteadiness, hallucinations, emesis, and respiratory distress.},

title={Preoxygenation: Physiologic Basis, Benefits, and Potential Risks},
journal={Anesthesia {\&} Analgesia},
year={2017},
volume={124},
number={2},
abstract={Preoxygenation before anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation is a widely accepted maneuver, designed to increase the body oxygen stores and thereby delay the onset of arterial hemoglobin desaturation during apnea. Because difficulties with ventilation and intubation are unpredictable, the need for preoxygenation is desirable in all patients. During emergence from anesthesia, residual effects of anesthetics and inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade can lead to hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and loss of airway patency. In accordance, routine preoxygenation before the tracheal extubation has also been recommended. The objective of this article is to discuss the physiologic basis, clinical benefits, and potential concerns about the use of preoxygenation. The effectiveness of preoxygenation is assessed by its efficacy and efficiency. Indices of efficacy include increases in the fraction of alveolar oxygen, increases in arterial oxygen tension, and decreases in the fraction of alveolar nitrogen. End points of maximal preoxygenation (efficacy) are an end-tidal oxygen concentration of 90{\%} or an end-tidal nitrogen concentration of 5{\%}. Efficiency of preoxygenation is reflected in the rate of decline in oxyhemoglobin desaturation during apnea. All investigations have demonstrated that maximal preoxygenation markedly delays arterial hemoglobin desaturation during apnea. This advantage may be blunted in high-risk patients. Various maneuvers have been introduced to extend the effect of preoxygenation. These include elevation of the head, apneic diffusion oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), bilevel positive airway pressure, and transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange. The benefit of apneic diffusion oxygenation is dependent on achieving maximal preoxygenation, maintaining airway patency, and the existence of a high functional residual capacity to body weight ratio. Potential risks of preoxygenation include delayed detection of esophageal intubation, absorption atelectasis, production of reactive oxygen species, and undesirable hemodynamic effects. Because the duration of preoxygenation is short, the hemodynamic effects and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species are insufficient to negate its benefits. Absorption atelectasis is a consequence of preoxygenation. Two approaches have been proposed to reduce the absorption atelectasis during preoxygenation: a modest decrease in the fraction of inspired oxygen to 0.8, and the use of recruitment maneuvers, such as CPAP, PEEP, and/or a vital capacity maneuver (all of which are commonly performed during the administration of anesthesia). Although a slight decrease in the fraction of inspired oxygen reduces atelectasis, it does so at the expense of a reduction in the protection afforded during apnea.},

We evaluated the association between capnograms and spirometry from subjects with OD with normal and restrictive lung disease (RD) subjects. The study was conducted in a prospective, nonrandomized manner using a convenience sample of 262 subjects presenting to a pulmonary function laboratory. Capnograms were recorded before pulmonary function testing. Subjects with OD had capnograms that were significantly different from normal and RD subjects. These differences were progressive, increasing with disease severity. The average take-off angle of the ascending phase for severe OD was 7.2 degrees less (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 4.0, 10.4) than for normals. The average alveolar plateau elevation angle was 0.8 degrees more (95{\%} CI: 0.14, 1.4) for moderate OD than for normals, whereas the average elevation angle was 3.6 degrees more (95{\%} CI: 2.9, 4.3) for severe OD than for normals. Differences between OD capnograms and normal and RD capnograms, correlating to changes in FEV1, were sufficiently large enough to suggest that the capnogram could be used to discriminate between OD and normal.},

abstract={Objective: To develop a clinical prediction rule that would be easy to apply and be useful for predicting success or failure of peripheral intravenous line insertion in children.Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 21 years undergoing peripheral intravenous placement by staff nurses in a pediatric emergency department. Information on candidate predictor variables was obtained before attempting intravenous placement, and the outcome was successful on first attempt. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify factors independently predictive of success. Those factors remaining in the model were used in a set of linear scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each model, and the areas under the curve were calculated.Results: Six hundred fifteen subjects were enrolled. Success rate for intravenous insertion on first attempt was 75{\%}. A 4-variable proportionally weighted rule (known as the difficult intravenous access [DIVA] score) was created (3 points for prematurity, 3 for younger than 1 year, 1 for 1-2 years of age, 2 for vein not palpable, and 2 for vein not visible). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.67. Subjects with a DIVA score of 4 or more were more than 50{\%} likely to have failed intravenous placement on first attempt.Conclusions: A clinical prediction rule that is easy to apply and is useful for predicting success or failure of peripheral intravenous insertion has been created. If externally validated, this DIVA score can be used to predict which children will have difficult intravenous access.},

    abstract = { In the last decade a growing amount of statistical research has been devoted to multiple testing, motivated by a variety of applications in medicine, bioinformatics, genomics, brain imaging, etc. Research in this area is focused on developing powerful procedures even when the number of tests is very large. This paper attempts to review research in modern multiple hypothesis testing with particular attention to the false discovery proportion, loosely defined as the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections. We review the main ideas, stepwise and augmentation procedures; and resampling based testing. We also discuss the problem of dependence among the test statistics. Simulations make a comparison between the procedures and with Bayesian methods. We illustrate the procedures in applications in DNA microarray data analysis. Finally, few possibilities for further research are highlighted. }

abstract={Study Objective To investigate factors affecting parental satisfaction with a pediatric sedation service in a university hospital setting. Design Prospective, observational study with interviews using a survey instrument. Setting Academic university hospital. Subjects Parents (or legal guardians; hereafter {\^a}{\texteuro}{\oe}parents") of 220 children scheduled for sedation with the hospital's pediatric sedation service. Interventions and Measurements Caregivers of children scheduled for sedation were interviewed using a validated survey instrument. The instrument was designed to investigate the quality of communication, environment, care provided, and the overall experience. We followed patients by telephone the day after discharge. Chi-square or linear-by-linear association tests were used to evaluate associations between satisfaction scores and demographic variables; the Mann-Whitney test was used for mean levels of satisfaction in anxious versus non-anxious children. Main Results Of 222 parents approached, 220 agreed to participate (response rate = 99.1{\%}). Significant associations between each area of satisfaction and parents' overall satisfaction existed (P < 0.001). Previous sedations, types of sedation, age of child, or any individual provider were not significantly associated with overall satisfaction. Caregivers of anxious children reported less satisfaction than caregivers of non-anxious children. Parents of children who underwent magnetic resonance imaging reported the lowest mean satisfaction scores. Conclusions Overall satisfaction was high, and care provided by anesthesiologists was significantly associated with overall satisfaction. A site in our institution was associated with significantly lower satisfaction as a result of inadequate space and privacy.},

abstract={As financial pressures drive health care to be more cost-effective and efficient, performing procedures outside the main operating room (MOR) is becoming more common. Pediatric sedation units (PSU) have proven both effective and safe at providing anesthesia for children. However, there is limited data available regarding the PSU and its potential application in pediatric otolaryngology. Objective To evaluate the experience of performing pediatric outpatient procedures in a PSU through a parental satisfaction survey. Methods Pediatric otolaryngology procedures performed in the PSU were prospectively recorded in a database. A prospective survey analysis was performed that measured parental satisfaction with scheduling/registration for surgery, nursing care, surgeon care, facility environment, timing/duration, and overall satisfaction. Parents completed this survey for outpatient procedures performed in either the PSU or in the MOR. The same attending surgeon was involved in all cases, with the only independent variable being the location of the surgery. Fifty surveys were collected for each group, and the surveys scores were statistically compared using nonparametric statistical analysis. Results Parental satisfaction was high in both the PSU and OR, with mean overall satisfaction scores of 4.8 and 4.9 (respectively) on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5. Parents reported greater clarity in preoperative information in the MOR (mean 4.8) compared to the PSU (mean 4.6) (p<0.006). Also, parents reported that MOR procedures started on time more often than those in the PSU (90{\^a}{\texteuro}``64{\%}, p<0.002). There were no significant differences between locations in any other survey metrics, with mean satisfaction scores ranging from 4.5 to 5.0. Conclusions The PSU is a satisfactory patient experience for outpatient procedures in pediatric otolaryngology at our institution. However, this parent survey has identified education prior to surgery and timeliness of surgery as two areas to improve to meet the satisfaction standard provided by the OR.},

abstract = {Abstract. Objective: To compare the effectiveness, recovery time from sedation, and complication rate of propofol with those of midazolam when used for procedural sedation in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Methods: A prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical trial comparing propofol and midazolam was conducted in the PED of a tertiary pediatric center. Eligible patients were aged 2-18 years with isolated extremity injuries necessitating closed reduction. All patients received morphine for pain, then were randomized to receive propofol or midazolam for sedation. Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and sedation scores were recorded prior to sedation and every 5 minutes thereafter until recovery. Recovery time, time from cast completion to discharge, and other time intervals during the PED course and all sedation-related complications were also recorded. Results: Between August 1996 and October 1997, 91 patients were enrolled. Demographic data, morphine doses, and sedation scores were similar between the propofol and midazolam groups. Mean ± SD recovery time for the propofol group was 14.9 ± 11.1 minutes, compared with 76.4 ± 47.5 minutes for the midazolam group, p < 0.001. Mild transient hypoxemia was the most significant complication, occurring in 5 of 43 (11.6\%) patients given propofol and 5 of 46 (10.9\%) patients given midazolam (odds ratio 1.08, 95\% CI = 0.24 to 4.76). Conclusion: In this study, propofol induced sedation as effectively as midazolam but with a shorter recovery time. Complication rates for propofol and midazolam were comparable, though the small study population limits the power of this comparison. Propofol may be an appropriate agent for sedation in the PED; however, further study is necessary before routine use can be recommended.},

abstract={Objective This meta-analysis of trials was conducted to evaluate the analgesic and side effects of ketamine-propofol combination (ketofol) in comparison to propofol in procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). Methods Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CINHAL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for clinical trial. The administration complications were the key outcomes of interest. Result Eighteen clinical trials that met our criteria were included in the analysis. Pooling of data showed that ketofol is significantly effective for reduction of respiratory complication and with relative risk (RR) of 0.31 in 14 trials (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.7; P = .001). Ketofol was also effective in reducing cardiovascular complications with hypotension RR of 0.11 in 9 trials (95{\%} CI, 0.17-0.97; P = .04) and bradycardia RR of 0.47 in 8 trials (95{\%} CI, 0.28-0.72; P = .008). The present study also showed that the summary of RR for psychomimetic complications was 1.95 in 13 trials were (95{\%} CI, 0.79-4.81; P = .15) and for muscle rigidity was 0.52 for 2 trials (95{\%} CI, 0.06-4.67; P = .56), and both were insignificant. In regard to nausea and vomiting, the RR was 1.23 in 12 trials (95{\%} CI, 0.39-3.88; P = .72) and insignificant. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates good safety profile in cardiorespiratory problems and comparable rate of other complications with propofol in adult procedural sedation and analgesia.},

abstract={Objectives To compare propofol with ketamine sedation delivered by pediatric intensivists during painful procedures in the pediatric critical care department (PCCD).Design Prospective 15-month study.Setting An 18-bed multidisciplinary, university-affiliated PCCD.Interventions All children were randomized to the propofol or ketamine protocol according to prescheduled procedure dates. Propofol was delivered by continuous infusion after a loading bolus dose and a minidose of lidocaine (PL). Ketamine was given as a bolus injection together with midazolam and fentanyl (KMF). Repeated bolus doses of both drugs were given to achieve the desired level of anesthesia. The studied variables included procedures performed, anesthetic drug doses, procedure and recovery durations, and side effect occurrence. The patient{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s parents, PCCD nurse and resident physician, pediatric intensivist, and the physician performing the procedure graded the adequacy of anesthesia.Measurements and Main Results Of the 105 procedures in 98 children, PL sedation was used in 58 procedures, and KMF was used in 47. Recovery time was 23 mins for PL and 50 mins for KMF, and total PCCD monitoring was 43 mins for PL and 70 mins for KMF. Five children (10.6{\%}) in the KMF group and in none in the PL group experienced discomfort during emergence from sedation. Transient decreases in blood pressure, partial airway obstruction, and apnea were more frequent in the PL than in the KMF sedation. All procedures were successfully completed, and no child recalled undergoing the procedure. The overall sedation adequacy score was 97{\%} for PL and 92{\%} for KMF (p < .05).Conclusions Both PL and KMF anesthesia are effective in optimizing comfort in children undergoing painful procedures. PL scored better by all evaluators, recovery from PL anesthesia after procedural sedation was more rapid, total PCCD stay was shorter with PL, and emergence from PL was smoother than with KMF. Because transient respiratory depression and hypotension are associated with PL, it is considered safe only in a monitored environment (e.g., a PCCD).},
